modulus

\overrightarrow{\rm A} + \overrightarrow{\rm B}= (3-1)i + (2 + 4)j + (5 + 1)k = 2i + 6j + 6k

\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 3\\ 4 & 6\\ \end{bmatrix} and \begin{bmatrix} 1 &-2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} ?

    6x – 3 = 2

    ⇒ 6x = 2 + 3

    ⇒ 6x = 5

    ⇒ x = 5 / 6 = 0.83

What does ∈ mean in Linear Algebra?

Scalars are represented by the Greek letters α, β, γ, λ, v, μ

≠ symbol mean Not equal to in linear algebra, it Demonstrates inequality.

P(X) symbol mean power set in linear algebra. It is the set that contains all possible subsets of a set A, including the set itself and the null set.
